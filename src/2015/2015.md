Writing this it is october 2022.

**Day 01:** Nice warm-up

**Day 02:** We do a little maths

**Day 03:** Copy pasting solution 1 bb

**Day 04:** Brute 👏 Force

**Day 05:** Yessss, RegEx my homie is back!!!

**Day 06:** I should learn to read before entering my solution 😓

**Day 07:** First real challenge, quite enjoyable :D

**Day 08:** Hex code representation? More like "6"

**Day 09:** I didn't ~~steal~~ write a Dijkstra algo for this day nooo. Couldn't even use it because its TSP :|  Ended up brute forcing it lol

**Day 10:** Fuck performance, ill wait those 2 seconds for my golden star lol. (recycling code FTW)

**Day 11:** Trust me, writing the regex was faster than thinking of an algorithm :L (also code recycling FTW)

**Day 12:** Okay most of my time was spent trying to make a RegEx for part 2 😓. As you can see: I failed.

**Day 13:** Day 9 again :|

**Day 14:** Part 1 was a nasty trick that was supposed to backfire on me for part 2. Jokes on the creator, I still did it with maths >:D

**Day 15:** Ashamed of this one.

**Day 16:** This one was pretty easy, both parts :)
