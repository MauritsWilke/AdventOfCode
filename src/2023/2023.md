# My thoughts on each day

Back again.

- **Day 01:** Started off strong with **#268** on global leaderboard for part 1, pretty proud of that. Part 2 was a different story, I didn't realise overlapping would be a thing (oneight = one, eight). Luckily I had overlapping regex code from 2016 which I did a week ago. 

- **Day 02:** No leaderboard today, because I cannot read. I tried a lot of incorrect things for part 1, before bothering to read the question. Part 2 was quite easy, for sure when compared to part 2 of day 1.

- **Day 03:** Grids aren't my thing. P1 took me longer than I'd like to admit, and had to postpone part 2 till later because of exam preparation and gym. Got to use my custom methods `.sum()` and `.product()` :D
