# My thoughts on each day

Back again.

- **Day 01:** Started off strong with **#268** on global leaderboard for part 1, pretty proud of that. Part 2 was a different story, I didn't realise overlapping would be a thing (oneight = one, eight). Luckily I had overlapping regex code from 2016 which I did a week ago. 

- **Day 02:** No leaderboard today, because I cannot read. I tried a lot of incorrect things for part 1, before bothering to read the question. Part 2 was quite easy, for sure when compared to part 2 of day 1.

- **Day 03:** Grids aren't my thing. P1 took me longer than I'd like to admit, and had to postpone part 2 till later because of exam preparation and gym. Got to use my custom methods `.sum()` and `.product()` :D

- **Day 04:** Not a huge fan of today, but that's because TS and me didn't agree on things. My parsing was correct, but TS kept giving errors, so I just told it to shut up and deal with it (aka @ts-ignore).

- **Day 05:** Part 1 was pretty doable, just a lot of reading. 

- **Day 06:** Difficulty went way down with this one. Didn't feel like submitting a brute force solution so I used maths üëç
