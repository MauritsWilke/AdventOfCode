# My thoughts on each day

- **Day 01:** Array modifiers go brrr

- **Day 02:** Not that happy with part 1, but this day I actually tried to get leaderboard. Bad choice if you manually have to get and enter everything ðŸ˜…

- **Day 03:** Was pretty slow today because I wanted to do the entirety of part 1 using only array modifiers (and I succeeded). I enjoy days that let me use RegEx, even though it is slow it's a fun puzzle.
