# My thoughts on each day

- **Day 01:** Array modifiers go brrr

- **Day 02:** Not that happy with part 1, but this day I actually tried to get leaderboard. Bad choice if you manually have to get and enter everything ðŸ˜…

- **Day 03:** Was pretty slow today because I wanted to do the entirety of part 1 using only array modifiers (and I succeeded). I enjoy days that let me use RegEx, even though it is slow it's a fun puzzle.

- **Day 04:** Finally fixed my spelling :L. It took me way too long to figure out why string comparison wasn't working because well TS wasn't yelling at me as it usually does. Ended up reducing my solutions by size after solve just a little.

- **Day 05:** This day was way more parsing than it was puzzling but nonetheless succeeded. Not really proud of my parsing solution but it is what it is ðŸ˜”

- **Day 06:** One of the easier days so far, but nonetheless enjoyable. Had to perform under stress as all my private leaderboard friends were online as well (still managed to get a #1 :D)

- **Day 07:** This day has posed the most problems for me. Biggest issue was that all my solutions gave the correct answer for the test case. Not feeling too bad about my final code but the time is a bit shameful ðŸ˜“

- **Day 08:** Grids ðŸ˜¬

- **Day 09:** Didn't wake up early today because I really needed my sleep. Problem was alright. I had some stupid mistakes but got them both first try nonetheless.

- **Day 10:** Honestly quite a fun day even though it took me way too long to realise I was using `every` instead of `some` ðŸ˜…

- **Day 11:** Part 1 was pretty easy, unlike part 2 which required me to know obscure prime maths modulo rules >:(  I must admit I didn't come up with the prime factorization myself hence the variable `magicNumberIFoundOnline`, but I do get how it works.

- **Day 12:** What a day. I learnt quite a lot about graphs and nodes today most of it being BFS. I ended up just translating the [wikipedia pseudocode][pseudocode] to TypeScript. A nifty thing I thought of today was using console.table to visualise XY maps which made it really easy to see if my parsing succeeded or not. Overall a pretty interesting day even if it was just implement an existing algorithm :)

- **Day 13:** Pretty doable day (unless you're solving at 6am ðŸ˜“). Kinda nice my compare function fitted right in with the built-in `.sort()` function. Haven't got much to say really Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

## Learnt
Late addition but here are the things I have learnt (or figured out myself) this year: 
 - You can convert to numbers by using `.map(Number)` instead of `map(v => +v)`
 <details>
 <summary>Code snippet</summary>

 ```ts
 const numbers = ["1","2","3"].map(Number);
 // => [1, 2, 3]
 ```
 </details>

 - A cheeky way to split a string into equal parts is to use regex capture groups
  <details>
 <summary>Code snippet</summary>

 ```ts
 const string = "I like cats!"
 const length = 4;
 const matcher = new RegExp(`.{${length}}`, "g");
 const splitString = string.match(matcher);
 // => ["I li", "ke c", "ats!"]
 ```
 </details>

- V8 optimises pieces of code when they're executed a lot. These pieces are also known as "hot code". Source: [logrocket.com][optimising]

- JavaScript has a `Math.sqrt(2)` constant: `Math.SQRT2`

- You can easily visualise grids by using `console.table()`
