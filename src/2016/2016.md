# My thoughts on each day

Using this to get back into programming, and I am bored :)

- **Day 01:** Getting back to logical thinking is challenging, but fun. Forgot that taxicab geometry is only positive.

- **Day 02:** The 2nd keypad was unexpected, but just pasting it in works 👍

- **Day 03:** I love using nothing but array modifiers, actually quite proud of how I did part 2. I think I haven't used this many different array modifiers at once before.

- **Day 04:** Part 1 was quite annoying, because the feature I wanted to use is too new for NodeJS. Part 2 was a breeze, didn't expect it

- **Day 05:** Almost the exact same as day 4 2015. Boring day because there is no smart way to do it...

- **Day 06:** I am too good at array modifiers. Part 2 was incredibly easy as I only had to change what element of an array I wanted to check :D

- **Day 07:** Array modifiers 🙏. Part 2 was challenging because I had to get an overlapping regex.

- **Day 08:** Part 2 was to just uncomment my debugging line, visualisation FTW.

- **Day 09:** Part 2 took me longer than I'd like to admit. Was being stubborn and forgot about recursion 😅

- **Day 10:** Pretty straightforward, biggest struggle was properly using objects. Part 2 wording messed me up because I assumed outputs could have more than 1 chip.

## Learnt
Late addition but here are the things I have learnt (or figured out myself) this year: 
 - To run code in a reduce function without brackets, use ternary statements (makes sense when viewing example)
 <details>
 <summary>Code snippet</summary>

 ```ts
 .reduce((a, b) => (a[b] = (a[b] || 0) + 1) ? a : a, {})
 // => Here the code is executed before just returning a
 ```
 </details>
