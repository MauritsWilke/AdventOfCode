# My thoughts on each day

Using this to get back into programming, and I am bored :)

- **Day 01:** Getting back to logical thinking is challenging, but fun. Forgot that taxicab geometry is only positive.

- **Day 02:** The 2nd keypad was unexpected, but just pasting it in works üëç

- **Day 03:** I love using nothing but array modifiers, actually quite proud of how I did part 2. I think I haven't used this many different array modifiers at once before.

- **Day 04:** Part 1 was quite annoying, because the feature I wanted to use is too new for NodeJS. Part 2 was a breeze, didn't expect it

- **Day 05:** Almost the exact same as day 4 2015. Boring day because there is no smart way to do it...

- **Day 06:** I am too good at array modifiers. Part 2 was incredibly easy as I only had to change what element of an array I wanted to check :D
