# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code

This repo holds my solutions for Advent of Code. All years will be in here as well as all the years. As of now it is just 2015 (and 2021 archives) with TS but soon 2022 will also be added.

## ðŸ›  How to use
To use this template, first download it and install the dependency:
```bash
 $ git clone --single-branch --branch template https://github.com/MauritsWilke/AdventOfCode.git

 # Not required but adviced:

 $ git branch -m main

 $ npm i
```

Open it in any editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended) and add a folder for the day you want to solve under its year (`2015/04`). Copy the files from [`template`](./template/) into the folder.

To run your solutions, make sure you compile first (`npx tsc`) and then run `node .` which will start the CLI.

If you have any questions on how to use the template, feel free to DM me on Discord: [`The Almighty One#3365`](https://discordapp.com/users/378874450105466880/)

- [ ] If you have a grid, check if the X and Y are correct in _all_ cases
