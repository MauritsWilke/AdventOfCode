# Advent of Code

Temp readme!

## How to use
To use this template, first download it:
```bash
 $ git clone --single-branch --branch template https://github.com/MauritsWilke/AdventOfCode.git

 # Not required but adviced:

 $ git branch -m main
```
Open it in any editor (Visual Studio Code recommended) and add a folder for the day you want to solve under its year (`2015/04`). Copy the files from [template](./template/) into the folder.

To run your solutions, make sure you compile first (`npx tsc`) and then run `node .`
