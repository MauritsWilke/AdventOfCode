# 🎄 Advent of Code - 2021

First year of Advent of Code, all challenges will be done with JS.

The first commit of a file is the first working code with solution, the second is the optimised code.

# ✏ Notes

**Day 1:** First day, easy challenge.

**Day 2:** Quite easy, nothing much to say about this one

**Day 3:** Challenge 2 was a pain, I haven't timed the time it took me to solve it but I know it was more than 2 hours 😭

**Day 4:** Most fun challenge so far, less fun is the BigO notation of my files 😬

**Day 5:** Today I learned that if you submit the wrong answer too many times you have to wait 10 minutes :D

**Day 6:** Easier than day 5, and quite fun. Did part 2 without rewriting because my code is so efficient 😎

**Day 7:** Scrap efficiency, O(input^2) for both :L

**Day 8:** This one honestly was fun, even though it took ages. I have had enough regex for the rest of my life

**Day 9:** Don't read my code for today, I cannot be bothered to make it better

**Day 10:** Array galore: Pop it! Push it! Map it! Sort it!

**Day 11:** Those octopi are adorable, problem not too bad to solve

**Day 12:** Yea about not visiting them twice...

**Day 13:** Great challenge, I did take the 'FKU' in my output personally though </3

**Day 14:** Part 2 was a great way to make me realise how stupid my part 1 code was :L
