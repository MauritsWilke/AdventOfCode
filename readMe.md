# 🎄 Advent of Code - 2021
First year of Advent of Code, all challenges will be done with JS.

The first commit of a file is the first working code with solution, the second is the optimised code.

# ✏ Notes
**Day 1:** First day, easy challenge.

**Day 2:** Quite easy, nothing much to say about this one

**Day 3:** Challenge 2 was a pain, I haven't timed the time it took me to solve it but I know it was more than 2 hours 😭

**Day 4:** Most fun challenge so far, less fun is the BigO notation of my files 😬

**Day 5:** Today I learned that if you submit the wrong answer too many times you have to wait 10 minutes :D
