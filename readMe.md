# 🎄 Advent of Code - 2021
First year of Advent of Code, all challenges will be done with JS.

The first commit of a file is the first working code with solution, the second is the optimised code.

# ✏ Notes
**Day 3:** Challenge 2 was a pain, I haven't timed the time it took me to solve it but I know it was more than 2 hours 😭
